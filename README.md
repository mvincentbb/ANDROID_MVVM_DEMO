## Architecture

---

The architecture that I use is MVVM

![Untitled](screenshots/Untitled.png)

### Data source

1. **The remote data :**

Data is collecting from an API

1. **The local data**
- SQLite is the local data source. Each table is represented by entity.
- Room is an abstraction layer over SQLite that allows us to have quick and efficient access to the sqlite database
- DAO or Domain Access Object allows us to make queries to the Room Database

### **Repository**

Is where we get data and define the source of truth of our data.

Two cases :

- ‚úÖ¬†**There is internet connection**  : We get data first from the remote source and we cached them in the room database calling DAO functions
- ‚ùå¬†**There is no connection :** Data is collected from cached data early store in the local  room database

### ViewModel

Store data for the UI layer

### UI Controller

- Activity
- Adapter

## Third party libraries

---

- **Glide**¬†for image loading
- **Hilt**: for¬†dependency injection
- **Kotlin Coroutines**¬†for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks

## Requirements

---

- Android Studio Arctic Fox | **2020.3.1**  or higher
- Minimun android SDK version  : **21**
- Target android  SDK version :  **29**
