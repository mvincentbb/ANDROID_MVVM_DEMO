ðŸ“± Mobile Demo Project

Build a sample mobile application (iOS or Android) that displays a list of posts. The application should have 2 screens:

#### Posts (or Home) Screen

The main screen of the app displaying a list of posts. You can use the following API to retrive the posts: [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

#### Detail Screen

When a post is tapped, the application should navigate to the post's detail screen. For each post, the detail screen will display:

- it's author
- it's description
- it's number of comments.

Use the following APIs to retrieve a post's details:

- [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments)
- [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

## Requirements

- The code should compile and run.
- The code should be of production quality.
- The application should be able to run offline (unless the user is accessing the app for the first time and they're offline).

## How to submit

- Clone this repo.
- Create a new branch from `main` in this repo for your work.
- Once your work is done, push your branch and open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
- Document in the pull request description (or in the README) how to compile, run, and test your code.


Happy coding ðŸŽ‰
